  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# Atleast one job should be there

  build:
    # The type of machine (runner/ OS) that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # Each step will run in its own process
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # uses defines the location of that action. Action is a bundle of code and is a docker image.
      # If we are not using action attribute, we use run attribute
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners (OS) shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
